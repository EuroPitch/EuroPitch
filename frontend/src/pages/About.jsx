        <h2>About EuroPitch</h2>
        <p>
        EuroPitch exists to bridge the gap between academic stock pitching and real‑world markets.
        Societies host their own selection rounds, finalists trade during an online phase, and
        teams finally present their approach at our annual conference.

        <ul className="bullets">
        <li>Educational focus — workshops and resources for each stage.</li>
        <li>Pan‑European reach — rotating host country based on the champions.</li>
        <li>Career‑ready skills — research, risk management, and communication.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
        EuroPitch was founded in April 2024, by multiple European university investment societies,
        with the aim, championed by students, to create a Pan‑European investment competition
        that combines student learning with mutual growth between societies across Europe.

        The inaugural EuroPitch competition will take place during the 2025–26 academic year,
        with the final conference scheduled for March 2026 in London.
